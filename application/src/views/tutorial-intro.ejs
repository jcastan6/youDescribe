    Becoming our game player:
    <br />
    Before you begin the game, you will need to successfully complete a
    tutorial. For the tutorial, you will complete 20 test ratings. You need to
    earn at least 40 points in the tutorial to unlock and start the actual game.
    If you don’t earn at least 40 points, you will be sent to another pass of
    the tutorial and will complete 20 more test ratings. As it was explained in
    “how your score is calculated”, we want game players to rate image-captions
    with values that are closely aligned with the community consensus.
